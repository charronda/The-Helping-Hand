	    <h3>We are a group of Volunteers</h3>
	    <p class="">focused on providing information pertaining to homelessness awareness, charities, and events to people wanting to volunteer to help the homeless, in the local Atlanta area and other areas as well. Providing opportunities to those charities guided by a fundamental commitment to human rights and the alleviation of human suffering. Helping Hand seeks to break new ground and not duplicate the effective efforts of others, and assist homeless persons to find food, shelter and life skills to aid them in their recovery from homelessness. A nonpartisan organization, actively seeking complementary partnerships and works collaboratively with other organizations from the local communities.</p>
